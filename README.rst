nuclai.16 Hands-On Workshops
============================

This repository contains the source code and data to participate in the workshops at the nucl.ai Conference 2016.  Programs should work on Windows, Linux and Mac OSX with Python.

You'll find multiple folders here:

1. **image —** On Tuesday 19th, workshop about image synthesis with convolutional networks.
2. **text —** On Wednesday 20th, workshop about generating text with recurrent networks. 
3. **animation —** On Wednesday 20th, beginner tutorial about motion matching. 
4. ...

For most demos, we recommend installing `Miniconda <http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html>`_. This will allow you to create new Python environments easily and install the appropriate packages:

.. code:: bash
    conda create -n py35 python=3.5
    activate py35
  
See each sub-folder for further details and instructions.
