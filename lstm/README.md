# nucl.ai Workshops 2015

This repository contains the source code and data to participate in the workshops at the nucl.ai Conference 2016.  Programs should work on Windows, Linux and Mac OSX with Python 3.5.

## Installation & Dependencies

### Deep Learning Backend 

You need to install [Theano](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/install.html#install)(preferable) or [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.9/get_started/os_setup.html#pip-installation). The preferable backend is Theano, since keras (will be installed later) uses it as the default backend.

### Keras - Deep Learning library 

To install keras follow the official [documentation](http://keras.io/#installation)
